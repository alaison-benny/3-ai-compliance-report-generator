# 📋 EU AI Act Technical Documentation Generator (Annex IV)

This tool automates the creation of a "Technical File" required by **Article 11** of the EU AI Act. 

### 🛡️ The Problem
For "High-Risk" AI systems, the EU requires a 10-part technical dossier before the system can be placed on the market. Most startups fail because their documentation is manual, inconsistent, and disconnected from their code.

### 🚀 The "ActReady" Solution
This project demonstrates how to:
1. **Extract Metadata:** Automatically pull model parameters and data lineage from AWS.
2. **Map to Annex IV:** Structure technical data into the exact format required by EU regulators.
3. **Version Control Compliance:** Store documentation as code (DaC), ensuring the report updates every time the model is retrained.

### ⚖️ Regulatory Mapping
- **Annex IV, Section 1:** General description and intended purpose.
- **Annex IV, Section 2:** Detailed description of development and data provenance.
- **Annex IV, Section 5:** Risk management system documentation.
